<CONSTANT INSTRUCTIONS-HEADER "|HOW TO USE THIS E-ADVENTURE|">
<CONSTANT INSTRUCTIONS-TEXT "Fabled Lands: Over the Blood-Dark sea is a digital gamebook -- an interactive game where the choices that you make correspond to numbered sections in the game. In moving through these sections you are creating a unique story for your adventuring persona.||You will begin your adventure by choosing a pre-generated character or a profession (see below)with the ability scores and Stamina that correspond to that profession at 1st Rank.||ABILITIES|---------||You have six abilities. Your initial score in each ability is decided by your choice of profession. Ability scores range from 1 (low ability) to 6 (a high level of ability). Ability scores will change during your adventure but can never be lower than 1 or higher than 12.||CHARISMA the knack of befriending people|COMBAT the skill of fighting|MAGIC the art of casting spells|SANCTITY the gift of divine power and wisdom|SCOUTING the techniques of tracking and wilderness lore|THIEVERY the talent for stealth and lock picking||STAMINA|-------||Stamina is lost when you get hurt. Keep track of your Stamina score throughout your travels and adventures. You must guard against your Stamina score dropping to zero, because if it does you are dead.||Lost Stamina can be recovered by various means, but your Stamina cannot go above its initial score until you advance in Rank.||You start with 16 Stamina points.||RANK|----||You start at 1st Rank. By completing quests and overcoming enemies, you will have the chance to go up in Rank.||You will be told during the course of your adventures when you are entitled to advance in Rank. Characters of higher Rank are tougher, luckier and generally better able to deal with trouble.||POSSESSIONS|-----------||You can carry up to twelve possessions on your person. All characters begin with 16 Shards in cash and the following possessions:||* sword|* leather jerkin (Defence +1)||Remember that you are limited to carrying a total of 12 items, so if you get more than this you'll have to cross something off your inventory or find somewhere to store extra items. There is no limit to how much money you can carry.||DEFENCE|-------||Your Defence score is equal to:||* your COMBAT score|* plus your RANK|* plus the bonus for the armour you're wearing (if any)||Every suit of armour you find will have a Defence bonus listed for it. The higher the bonus, the better the armour. You can carry several suits of armour if you wish -- but because you can wear only one at a time, you only get the Defence bonus of the best armour you are carrying.||To start with, it is just your COMBAT score plus 2 (because you are 1st Rank and have +1 DEFENSE).||It will be updated if you get better armour or increase in Rank or COMBAT ability.||ADDITIONAL HELP|---------------||During action selection and in other parts of the game, pressing '?' brings up a list of additional command keys.">

<CONSTANT TEXT001 "You are alone in an open boat waiting for death.||How your life has changed since the day that you set out from your homeland across the Unbounded Ocean! You had signed on aboard a ship in the hope of visiting a dozen ports, seeing a thousand wonders. But calamity overtook your voyage in the first week, when pirates swooped down upon the vessel. You and a handful of shipmates managed to get the cutter down into the water and were making off, but some of the pirates leapt down from the rail right in your midst. The fighting was hard. You remember little of it now, but when it was over the boat was awash with blood and you were the only one left alive. Of your own ship and the pirates' there was no sign -- the current had carried you out of sight of any living thing.||Best not to think how you've survived since then. At the mercy of the wind and the currents, you have been swept steadily westwards into regions completely unknown to you. Drinking water has been your biggest problem -- you've had to rely on rain and there has been none for days. Your body is weak, your spirits low. Then, just as death seems ready to draw his boat alongside, you see something that kindles new hope. White clouds. Birds turning high above. The grey hump of land on the horizon!||Steering towards the shore, you feel the cutter lurch as it enters rough water. The wind whips up plumes of spindrift and breakers pound the cliffs. The tiller is yanked out of your hands. The little boat is spun around, out of control, and goes plunging towards the coast.||You leap clear at the last second. There is the snap of timber, the roaring crescendo of the waves -- and then silence as you go under. Striking out wildly, you try to swim clear, then suddenly a wave catches you and flings you contemptuously on to the beach.||You are battered and bedraggled, but alive. Now your adventures can begin.">
